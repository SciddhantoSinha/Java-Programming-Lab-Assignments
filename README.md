# Java-Programming-Lab-Assignments

This repository contains all experiments and practical programs completed as part of the **Java Programming Lab** course.  
The lab focuses on building a strong foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Java through hands-on problem solving.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

- Understand **Object-Oriented Programming principles** such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism  
- Develop Java programs using **classes, objects, methods, and packages**  
- Apply **inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling**  
- Implement **multithreading concepts**  
- Build GUI applications using **AWT and Swing**  
- Perform **file handling and JDBC database operations**
